🚀 Approach
1. Data Cleaning
•	Removed irrelevant columns: Name, Ticket, and Cabin.
•	Imputed missing values: 
o	Age: Filled with the mean age.
o	Fare: Filled with the mean fare in the test set.
o	Embarked: Filled with the mode value.
2. Feature Engineering
•	Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) using LabelEncoder.
•	Created a new feature, FamilySize, by summing SibSp and Parch.
3. Data Preprocessing
•	Separated the target variable (Survived) from the features.
•	Standardized numerical features (Age, Fare) using StandardScaler.
4. Model Building
•	Used Random Forest Classifier with 100 trees and entropy criterion.
•	Split the training data into training and validation sets using an 80-20 split.
5. Model Evaluation
•	Achieved accuracy on validation set using accuracy_score.
•	Used 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's stability: 
o	Mean Accuracy: X.XX%
o	Standard Deviation: Y.YY%
•	Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters: 
o	Best Accuracy: Z.ZZ%
o	Best Parameters: {...}
6. Final Submission
•	Predicted survival for the test dataset.
•	Saved predictions to submission.csv for Kaggle leaderboard submission.
